##### The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 precisely defines the scope of our survey. Then, Section 3 presents our ... scheme, which is applied in Section 4 to provide elementary complexity results. Section 5 takes a closer look on how optimization can be applied during the daily operations of a sharing platform. Applying our parking example from Fig. 1, we quantify the value of optimization (compared to the list-based approach) for different batching intervals by a computational experiment. Furthermore, we apply our deterministic matchings in a dynamic, stochastic, and opportunistic environment. Finally, Section 6 elaborates future research needs and concludes the paper.
